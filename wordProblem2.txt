The height of a building in New York is 200 feet while you stand 100 feet away from it. 
You want to find the distance in feet from the point you are standing to the top of the 
building. What is the distance from the point in which you are standing to the point 
at the top of the building to the nearest tenth? (Hint: The building and the ground are 
perpendicular). Use the text area to answer this question and make sure to indicate the 
full name of the unit without any capitalizations (ex: inches).
